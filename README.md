## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned about the **62.5% Font Size Trick**. ~~From what I understand, there are few, if any, disadvantages to using this trick.~~ After reading about this topic I understood that this trick is not as great as it sounds. [Grace Snow wrote a great article about why.](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/rem-html-font-size-hack/) A few articles recommended using CSS variables instead. I can see the advantage of this, especially if I'm using utility classes for the project.

Speaking of **utility classes**. I just learned that they exist. They don't seem useful for small projects like this one, but I will definitely use them in the future.

I have also been researching when to use `grid` or `flexbox` since, I'm almost exclusively use flexbox right now. [Kevin Powell made an amazing video diving deep into this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3elGSZSWTbM)

### Continued development

I want to use `grid` more in the future. It's also important to me to continue to learn about best practices and accessibility.

Units like `rem` and `em` are still a little unclear to me. I understand what they do. But I don't fully understand when to use what and why. I need to do some more research!

### Useful resources

They also included options for the 62.5% Font Size Trick.
